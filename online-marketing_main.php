                            Social media optimization (SMO) is the use of a number of outlets and communities to
                            generate publicity to increase the awareness of a product, service brand or event. Types of
                            social media involved include RSS feeds, social news and bookmarking sites, as well as
                            social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, video sharing websites and blogging
                            sites. SMO is similar to search engine optimization, in that the goal is to generate web
                            traffic and to a site and increase awareness for a website.</p>
                        <p align="justify">The goal of SMO is to strategically create interesting online content,
                            ranging from well-written text to eye-catching digital photos or video clips that encourages
                            and entices people to engage with a website and then share this content, via its weblink,
                            with their social media contacts and friends.

                                    height="137" class="alignleft" /></a>
                            Social media marketing (SMM) is a form of Internet marketing that utilizes social networking
                            websites as a marketing tool. The goal of SMM is to produce content that users will share
                            with their social network to help a company increase brand exposure and broaden customer
                            reach.</p>
                        <p align="justify"> SMM became more common with the increased popularity of websites such as
                            Twitter, Facebook, Blogging, LinkedIn, and YouTube etc…

                            Facebook
                            Twitter
                            LinkedIn
                            Google+
                            Pinterest
                            YouTube
                            Blogging etc</p>

                        <h2>Pay-Per-Click (PPC)</h2>
                        <p align="justify"><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery1]" title="Image Title"

                                    class="alignleft" /></a>
                            Pay-per-click is commonly associated with first-tier search engines (such as Google AdWords
                            and Microsoft Bing Ads). With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases
                            relevant to their target market. In contrast, content sites commonly charge a fixed price
                            per click rather than use a bidding system. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> PPC “display” advertisements, also known as “banner” ads, are shown on web
                            sites with related content that have agreed to show ads and are typically not pay-per-click
                            advertising. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have also adopted pay-per-click as
                            one of their advertising models.</p>
