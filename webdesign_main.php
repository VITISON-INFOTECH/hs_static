                            Your web site may begin to look outdated. It's time for a new look, more user-friendly
                            navigation, a more web savvy logo and easy-to-scan-through presentation of content. You may
                            find that new graphic design and flash development will add to your users experience. It's
                            time for a redesign. This will require, looking at your web site with new eyes, as a visitor
                            would see it. Does it communicate? Is it effective? What are your goals for the web site?
                            Are they being achieved? A redesign can sometimes be more complicated than the creation of a
                            new website. You will have to decide how much of the old site to use and how much to throw
                            away. It's important to note that pages that are indexed with search engines should not be
                            deleted or their URL changed.
